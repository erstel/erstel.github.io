          When you hang up, you know you’ll regret saying yes, but $500k is hard
          to turn down. As you are about to get into your car, you notice the
          peaceful sound of the wind in the forest. You know you’re risking
          undoing the progress you’ve made since returning to the States, but
          this mission is one way to escape the boredom of normal life.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you arrive, you are escorted to a large room with 30 people
          frantically typing and talking to each other. You see three people
          with their eyes closed, surrounded by wires and computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          A woman walks up to you and extends her hand, “General”
        </p>

        <p>
          “Director, what’s the mission?”
        </p>

        <p>
          “For eight years, we have been developing completely AI-driven
          weaponry - robots that can experience the terror of war so we don’t
          have to. We were testing Phase 2 in a computer-simulated environment
          when…” she looks down. “Things got out of control. The AI started to
          rapidly learn, and we aren’t sure what happened after that. They cut
          off all communication to and from the simulation. Unfortunately, we
          already had people combat-testing in the simulation when this
          happened, and we can’t unlink them with the communication cut off.
        </p>

        <p>
          “That’s where you come in. I need you to enter the simulation,
          re-establish communication and lead our testers to a portal. That
          portal is the only way out of there now. Get out of there as soon as
          all the testers are safe.”

        Back in February of 2019, Caleb and Daniel met on discord, and said they
        should make a game together. They began looking for a game jam, and
        found Cosmo D's Game Jam. The theme they had to follow was "City".
        Daniel and Caleb began working in March, once the contest began. In that
        month, they made Phone Call Home, a totally free game. In order to enter
        the game to the contest, Caleb and Daniel came up with the name for our
        team, Erstel Games, an Indie game dev team. After about a year, they
        re-did the game, and it is now known as Morakk, although Phone Call Home
        is still available. After a while of working on Morakk, Erstel decided
        to pause Morakk, and began working on a smaller scale game, Protosim.
        Protosim was made for a game jam entry, but has since been worked on. We
        also have some big plans for Protosim coming up! This is why we began
        working on Protosim.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are working on Protosim with the hopes of fully publishing it. We
        want to bring a unique game with an in depth story by indie developers
        to the market. We plan on reworking the game from what it is currently,
        and here are some of our ideas: We are adding a beginning to the game,
        where the story begins. We will redo the graphics to make it look more
        realistic, and also to help the story build. We will help further the
        story with every action in the game. These are just some of the ideas we
        have. This is what we plan on doing with Protosim, and where we get our
        drive for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The biggest challenge we faced while developing the game was making time
        travel work. Everything in the game that could change had to be tracked
        over time. The hard part was working out the details of the mechanic. As
        the player, you quickly go back in time as you hold down F. After
        traveling back in time, the future should be erased, because you could
        decide to walk in a different direction then.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Caleb implemented the core mechanics and Daniel created the
        models, the next challenge was making the game balanced. At first, the
        Fears moved much faster than you. The only way to escape them was using
        time travel, but too often they would come out of no where and reach you
        before you had time to react. We made the Fears slower and gave the
        player the ability to place force fields that temporarily keep the
        enemies in stasis. In a future release, we plan to add an audio cue for
        when a Fear approaches you. Hopefully, the game is not too hard and not
        too easy currently. Let us know what you think in the Discord server!
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope you enjoy the game and let us know you thoughts on it. After
        all, you are our community, so you can be involved in the development
        process too!
