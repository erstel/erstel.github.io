They began looking for a game jam, and found Cosmo D\'s Game Jam. The theme they had to follow was "City". Daniel and Caleb began working in March, once the contest began. In that month, they made Phone Call Home, a totally free game. In order to enter the game to the contest, Caleb and Daniel came up with the name for our team, Erstel Games, an Indie game dev team. After about a year, they re-did the game, and it is now known as Morakk, although Phone Call Home is still available. After a while of working on Morakk, Erstel decided to pause Morakk, and began working on a smaller scale game, Protosim. Protosim was made for a game jam entry, but has since been worked on.

We will redo the graphics to make it look more realistic, and also to help the story build. We will help further the story with every action in the game. These are just some of the ideas we have.

We made the Fears slower and gave the player the ability to place force fields that temporarily keep the enemies in stasis.
